Yes, **Firebase** is a viable alternative for your staff portal’s secure authentication and real-time event sync, and it can work with GitHub Pages since it provides a client-side JavaScript SDK. Firebase offers a free tier (Spark Plan) that’s suitable for low-traffic applications like yours, eliminating the need for additional hosting providers. Below, I’ll explain why Firebase fits, how it compares to the enhanced export/import workaround, and provide a detailed implementation to replace the current `localStorage`-based system in `staff-portal.html`.

### Why Firebase Fits
- **GitHub Pages Compatibility**: Firebase’s SDK runs in the browser, so you can integrate authentication and real-time data sync directly in your static site hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **Secure Authentication**: Firebase Authentication supports email/password, OAuth (e.g., Google), and anonymous logins with robust security (JWT tokens, managed user sessions).
- **Real-Time Sync**: Firestore (Firebase’s database) offers real-time listeners, so event updates sync instantly across users without manual pulls.
- **Free Tier (Spark Plan)**:
  - Firestore: 1GB storage, 50,000 reads/day, 20,000 writes/day.
  - Authentication: Unlimited users.
  - Sufficient for low-traffic staff portals.
- **Simplicity**: Minimal setup (API keys, SDK), no server management, and an admin console for user/event management.
- **Scalability**: Handles low traffic easily and scales if needed (though you’d monitor usage to stay free).

### Comparison to Export/Import Workaround
- **Enhanced Export/Import (Previous Response)**:
  - **Pros**: No external services, stays within GitHub Pages, simple to extend existing code, completely free (no usage limits).
  - **Cons**: Manual sync (users click “Pull Data”/“Push Data”), less secure (client-side auth, GitHub token risks), not real-time.
  - **Best For**: Minimal setup, avoiding third-party accounts, accepting manual updates.
- **Firebase**:
  - **Pros**: Automatic real-time sync, secure authentication, no manual file sharing, robust infrastructure, free for low traffic.
  - **Cons**: Requires Firebase account, learning curve (API setup), potential costs if traffic spikes (unlikely for you), external dependency.
  - **Best For**: True real-time sync, secure user management, modern backend feel.

**Recommendation**: **Firebase** is the better choice if you want **secure authentication** and **live data sync** without manual steps, which aligns with your goal of events being visible across users/PCs instantly. The free tier covers your low-traffic needs, and setup is straightforward. The export/import workaround is simpler but lacks real-time updates, making Firebase more suitable for a seamless staff portal experience.

### Firebase Implementation
I’ll update `staff-portal.html` to use Firebase for authentication and event storage, replacing the mock user database and `localStorage`. Schedules will also use Firestore for consistency. `index.html` and `styles.css` need minor tweaks for navigation consistency, but the focus is on the staff portal. The hero scroll and hamburger menu fixes from earlier remain intact.

#### Approach
- **Authentication**:
  - Use Firebase Authentication (email/password).
  - Replace mock `users` array with Firebase user management.
  - Add sign-up for admins to create accounts (optional).
- **Events and Schedules**:
  - Store in Firestore collections (`events`, `schedules`).
  - Enable real-time listeners for live table updates.
  - Restrict actions (e.g., only admins can edit/delete).
- **UI**:
  - Keep login form, tables, and admin controls.
  - Remove export/import buttons (replaced by Firestore sync).
  - Add user feedback (e.g., “Syncing…”).
- **Security**:
  - Use Firestore rules to limit access.
  - Store Firebase config securely (safe for client-side).
